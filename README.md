### Project Overview
This project explores Zomato‚Äôs restaurant dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights into restaurant ratings, cuisine distribution, pricing trends, and customer preferences. The analysis helps in understanding key factors influencing restaurant success and user engagement.
